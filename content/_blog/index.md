Hello World.

I have been trying to figure out how I could use Obsidian to create a blog on technical researches I have made on my free time regarding Malware Analysis related matters.

I followed the tutorial [here](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/How+to+publish+Obsidian+notes+with+Quartz+on+GitHub+Pages) and it was a lot more time consuming than I thought because I wanted my page to be at `balapoopi.github.io` and not `balapoopi.github.io/balapoopi`.

With my many years of Google search experience, I was finally able to find what I was looking for [here](https://gist.github.com/codeadamca/bc3dcb6fc768ee1714918aa15cf13fad).
